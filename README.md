# CodingNepal & CodingLab Tutorials

In this space I'll upload the projects I'm following along from the channels [CodingNepal](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingNepal) and [CodingLab](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingLabYT)

The projects uploaded aren't 100% faithful to the originals; I'll write down each change done here. 

### 1. Music Player

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CvPn4AbT4&t=4548s&ab_channel=CodingNepal) you can watch the whole tutorial

The project consists in a music player which, besides playing the music, lets the user select each song from a whole album through a track list. 

* Changes done
    1. The color scheme was slightly altered
    2. The music was replaced by a Nirvana album which has non of their songs
    3. The song used is just Better Days by Lakey Inspired ([here](https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/better-days)) repeated over and over (the song is uncopyrighted)
    4. I directly downloaded the icons from [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons), meaning some major changes to the CSS and JavaScript files
    5. There's just a single album cover and I had to recreate it with paint to avoid any copyright infringement

### 2. Card Slider

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QE8dXq9SOE&ab_channel=CodingNepal) you can watch the whole tutorial

The project consists in a card slider which can be used as a staff introduction or anything of the sort. The slider moves every 2500 ms, can be moved with a left and right buttons, and has an "infinite" effect to it. 

* Changes done
    1. The color scheme has been slightly altered
    2. The images and names have been changed; each image was taken from [pixels](https://www.pexels.com/). The file "info of pictures.txt" has the links to the respective sources
    3. I directly downloaded the icons from [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons), but this time around this meant minor changes to the CSS and JavaScript files

### 3. Snake Game

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Rh5x3c9Pw&ab_channel=CodingNepal) you can watch the whole tutorial

The project consists in a Snake game, with high score that is saved in the local storage and controls for small devices. 

* Changes done
    1. I messed a bit with the colors
    2. I directly downloaded the icons from [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons). Little to no changes in the CSS file

### 4. Website with Login & Registration Form 

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etsPyHLON7g&ab_channel=CodingLab) you can watch the whole tutorial

I'm finally back from winter break! Back at it again with an HTML, CSS and JS project. 

The project itself consists in a simple website with a login and registration form. 

* Changes done
    1. I've messed a bit with the colors
    2. I directly downloaded the icons from [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons). This meant some changes to the CSS and Javascript files 
    3. To do away with the default icons in the password input, I've used [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18970150/how-can-i-remove-the-eye-from-a-password-field) workaround so I could work with the icons I downloaded
