# CodingNepal Tutorials

In this space I'll upload the projects I'm following along from the channel [CodingNepal](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingNepal)

The projects uploaded aren't 100% faithful to the originals; I'll write down each change done here. 

### 1. Music Player

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CvPn4AbT4&t=4548s&ab_channel=CodingNepal) you can watch the whole tutorial

* Changes done
    1. The color scheme was slightly altered
    2. The music was replaced by a Nirvana album which has non of their songs
    3. The songs used are just Better Days by Lakey Inspired ([here](https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/better-days)) repeated over and over (the song is uncopyrighted)
    4. I directly downloaded the icons from [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons), meaning some major changes to the CSS and JavaScript files
